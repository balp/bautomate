The idea is to make an east page so i can turn my light on and off
form a webpage. It should work form a computer or any mobile phone.

The current host enviroment is a Raspbery Pie, a Telldus tellstick,
a bunch of Nexa remote controlled switches.

In addition to this software the open source Telldus libraries are used
and a pytyhon ctypes library to this.
